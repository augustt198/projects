I worked in a group of three to create a game of mixed virtual/physical checkers.
The system allows two people to play a game of checkers in separate locations -
players move their own physical pieces and view their opponent's virtual pieces on
a display. The setup looked like this:

My portion of the project was the computer vision system that used input from
a camera to detect the player's physical pieces and send that information to
the game logic module. Here's an image of computer vision masking a single color:
